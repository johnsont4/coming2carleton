Coming2Carleton is a program for incoming freshmen at Carleton College that bridges the gap between enrollment and New Student Week by matching them with current students throughout the summer.
Connected to Google Drive (Sheets and Forms), the program is able to match students based on data they've entered in a Google Form.
Data included is academic interests, extracurricular activities, and backgrounds. Incoming students are able to choose which of the three characteristics they place the highest priority on (or no preference), and a match is made.
